# Block-Suggested-YouTube-Videos
(Work in progress) A chrome extension that removes YouTube's video suggestions. Ever opened YouTube while trying to
be productive only to click on several videos that catch your eye, wasting 10-15 minutes at a time, and then forgetting
what it was you originally went on YouTube for? This extension aims to get rid of that temptation with the goal of making
your time on YouTube more intentional.
